## Warning:
I have decided that this project's structure has become spaghetti and is just too slippery to fix. Expect bugs and no more updates

## Features

- A lot of Events
- Saving of orginal world data/blocks
- Ability to force/respawn players onto certain teams
- Leaderboard for the best players
- Extensive config options

## Installation
1. Have a spigot or paper MC server
2. Download the latest .jar release 
3. Drop the .jar into your `/plugins` folder
4. Reload/Launch your server

## Updating
I recommend deleting your old `config.yml` file in-order to make sure new options are applied!

## Usage
- /wstart [size] [prepTime] [borderCloseTime] [borderCloseSpeed] [eventCooldown]: Starts the match
- /wend: Ends the match
- /wforceteam [player] [team]: Forces target player onto a team
- /wleaderboard: Shows the top five players of the walls
- Settings can be found in `/plugins/TheWalls/config.yml`

## Known Issues

- Not everything has been tested: there may be bugs

## Developers
