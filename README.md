# Features

- A lot of Events
- Saving of orginal world data/blocks
- Ability to force/respawn players onto certain teams
- Leaderboard for the best players
- Extensive config options

# Known Issues

- Not everything has been tested: there may be bugs
- Going over ~125 blocks for the size will cause a lot of lag when starting the game
- Sometimes the game may not end properly when a player dies (this should be fixed)
